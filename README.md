# garden-instruments
Repository of 'wrapper' classes I have created for multiple common instruments. This code was compiled for and tested on an ESP-8266 NodeMCU in the Arduino IDE. These classes are optimized to make it easy for the user to report sensor values to an MQTT broker quickly and easily.
